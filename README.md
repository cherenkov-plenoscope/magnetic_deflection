Estimate the magnetic deflection of airshowers in earth's atmosphere
--------------------------------------------------------------------


This tool uses KIT's CORSIKA to simulate the airshowers by cosmic-rays and their emission of Cherenkov-light.
The goal of this tool is to find:

- direction (w.r.t. zenith)
- position (w.r.t to observer)

a cosmic-ray must have in order for the observer to see its Cherenkov-light.

At energies > 10GeV the Cherenkov-light of an airshower is almost parallel to the direction of the primary particle.
However, at energies < 10GeV, earth's magnetic field bends the airshower so much that an offset occurs.
